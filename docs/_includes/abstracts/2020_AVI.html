  Building and maintaining knowledge about specific interface technologies is a
  challenge. Current solutions include standard file-based document
  repositories, wikis, and other online tools. However, these solutions are
  often only available in intranets, become outdated and do not support the
  acquisition of knowledge in an efficient manner. The effort to gain an
  overview and detailed knowledge about novel interface technologies can be
  overwhelming and requires to research and read many technical reports and
  scientific publications. We propose to implement open source online knowledge
  bases that include building blocks for creating custom workshops to understand
  and apply the contained knowledge.

  We demonstrate this concept with a knowledge base for shape-changing
  interfaces (SCI-KB). The SCI-KB is hosted online at GitHub and fosters
  collaborative creation of knowledge elements accompanied by practical
  exercises and workshop elements that can be combined and adapted by
  individuals or groups of people new to the topic of shape-changing interfaces.
