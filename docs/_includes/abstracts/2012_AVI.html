    In this paper we describe DepthTouch, an installation which 
    explores future interactive surfaces and features elastic feedback, 
    allowing the user to go deeper than with regular multi-touch 
    surfaces. DepthTouch's elastic display allows the user to create 
    valleys and ascending slopes by depressing or grabbing its textile 
    surface. We describe the experimental approach for eliciting 
    appropriate interaction metaphors from interaction with real 
    materials and the resulting digital prototype.
