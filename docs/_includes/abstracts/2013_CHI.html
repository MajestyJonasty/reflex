  This position paper describes our view on the current state of research in the
  domain of elastic displays. Elastic displays exhibit a number of unique
  properties: they enable varied haptic feedback, maintain consistency of shape,
  and afford natural physics. The main contribution of this paper is a
  systematic review of current technological and conceptual issues for enabling
  elastic displays. We discuss shortcomings that hamper a readily adoption of
  elastic displays and propose three directions for future research: elastic
  gestures, hooks, and gravibles.
