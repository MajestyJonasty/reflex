## Concept

![FlexiWall - Elastic Display as Display Wall]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/hardware/flexiwall_aufbau.png)

The __FlexiWall__ is an Elastic Display build as a large display wall. The deformable screen is made of an elastic fabric. Usually, _Lycra_ is used, which is a common fabric used for swimsuits. Due to the large size of the installation, the fabric needs to be purchased at special shops (The size of the screen is approx. 2.6m x 2.5m - most fabrics are only produced in panels of 1.5m width).

The visualization is generated by a projector behind the surface via back projection on the fabric. Therefore, the fabric needs to be white and translucent, and the image needs to be mirrored, which is usually done in the projector settings.

Finally, a depth camera which is mounted next to the projector is tracking the deformation of the fabric.

The whole system can be built using consumer hardware and inexpensive aluminium profiles. Again, due to the size of the installation, the aluminium frame is a little more expensive and needs some additional material for stabilization. Our approach was to build a stable shelve for the projector and the depth sensor and connect this with a lightweight frame for the display using two aluminum bars on the top.

Using a projector with a large throw ratio is recommended to minimize the size of the area behind the screen. The following image shows the floor plan for our installation using the hardware described in the [technical specification]({{ site.baseurl}}/hardware/flexiwall-specs).
