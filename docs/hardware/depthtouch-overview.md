## Concept

The __DepthTouch__ is an Elastic Display build as a tabletop. The deformable screen is made of an elastic fabric. Usually, _Lycra_ is used, which is a common fabric used for swimsuits and can be purchased in most textile shops.

The visualization is generated by a projector underneath the surface via back projection on the fabric. Therefore, the fabric needs to be white and translucent, and the image needs to be mirrored, which is usually done in the projector settings.

Finally, a depth camera which is mounted next to the projector is tracking the deformation of the fabric.

The whole system can be built using consumer hardware and inexpensive aluminium profiles. Based on the experience of the last years, we provide a [construction manual including part list]({{ site.baseurl}}/hardware/construction_manual) and [recommended hardware]({{ site.baseurl}}/hardware/depthtouch-specs).

Earlier prototypes used a mirror for extending the distance between projector and elastic surface. One issue of this approach is that mirror and projector need to be mounted precisely. Even then, controlling the image distortion was difficult and assembling the table was time-consuming. Furthermore, every vibration or shock applied to the frame when using the tabletop is transmitted to projector and mirror, therefore the image was often "shaky" and often the whole system needed a recalibration.

By using short throw projectors, the tabletop can be constructed without the need for a mirror, which makes adjusting the optical system rather easy and assembling the system is also less time consuming.
