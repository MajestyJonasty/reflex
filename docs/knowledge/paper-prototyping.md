# {{ page.title }}

A simple variant of the prototype production is the paper prototyping. It only requires some paper or a whiteboard and a pen. Ideas can be recorded and collected directly. Paper prototyping covers the essential key points of prototyping. The prototype can be modified directly at any time. Changes are directly visible and not hidden.

In the example pictures you can see how paper prototyping is used in combination with the created prototype of an Elastic Display. You can find the article about the creation of an Elastic Display prototype here ["How to build a prototype"](https://visualengineers.github.io/sci-knowledge-base/how-to-build-a-prototype/).
